<h3>Research and Action</h3>
<p>I found a lot of useful techniques online to help me with my first technical exercise. The first thing that helped me was researching information on media queries.  I then used this information to change certain attributes at certain breakpoints. I researched what sizes typical device were eg. tablet 768px , mobile 480px. Then used this to change the background colour at different points. For my website, at full sized desktop, the colour is a pale orange whilst the text is black. Was the viewport is decreased the size background colour changes to blue and the text changed to white. 
<br>
<br>
 I used information from stack-overflow to find out how to fetch the live viewport pixels. I tried this with native javascript first but  this only seemed to work when refreshing the page. I then found another solution using jQuery, which seemed to work perfectly.<br>
<br><br>

Some useful websites that helped me along the way:
<br>
<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.creativebloq.com/responsive-web-design/build-basic-responsive-site-css-1132756"> <strong>Building a Basic Responsive Website</strong></a>
<br>
This helped me with understanding the structure of how responsive websites work., although I didn't use this site directly for technical help.
<br>
<br>
<a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9828831/jquery-on-window-resize"> <strong>Displaying the viewport using jQuery - Realtime</strong></a>
<br>
This helped me display the viewport in realtime whilst resizing the screen. I orginally tried it with native JS but jQuery seemed to work better.
<br>
<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/community/my-website-is-not-responsive-for-mobile-devices"> <strong>Making the site display properly on mobile</strong></a>
I couldn't figure out why my site wasnt showing the attributes of my mobile queries. I did a quick google and found that this meta tag needed to be used <i> meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"></i> which seemed to fix the issue.

<br>
<br>
The thing that I learnt the most from this exercise was actually using media queries and understanding how they work with different screen dimensions. By placing each element/class inside each query it would then apply it as the window was resized.

<script>
  

$('#heightSpan').html($(window).height());
$('#widthSpan').html($(window).width());

$(window).on('resize', function(){
    $('#heightSpan').html($(window).height());
    $('#widthSpan').html($(window).width());
});
